Welcome to the world of Daria, a fantasy setting for RPG games! Within this site, you will find information about the setting as well as resources for building characters. This site is divided into two sections:
##### <span><img src="media/assets/robe.png" alt="Player Options" title="Player Options" style="width:auto;height:40px;position:relative;top:16px;"></span> [[Player Options]]
Use this section to reference rules and options for your character. This includes Class, Subclass, Species, and Backgrounds. Some of these rulesets will be linked to other sites due to licensing laws.
##### <span><img src="media/assets/world.png" alt="Player Options" title="Player Options" style="width:auto;height:40px;position:relative;top:16px;"></span> [[Daria|Setting Guide]]
Use this section to learn more about the world when creating your character or any other time you feel like it.

*It is not necessary or expected for you to read all this information; consider this a reference document. Use it how you are comfortable using it.*
