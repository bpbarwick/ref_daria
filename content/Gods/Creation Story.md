The oldest stories say that the world of Daria sprouted from a seed. They say that a blossom of the fabled lands called Feywild was pollinated when an interplanar wind gusted from the realm of Bedrock. The flower dropped a seed that twirled and spun through the aether only to plant itself among the chaos, sprouting and giving birth to Daria.
Beings from these other two worlds, filled with immense power, settled in Daria and began shaping it to their liking. These being would later in history be known as the Beast-Gods. Often times, creating things to oneâ€™s liking often leads to things that are not to the liking of others. Many wars ensued between the Beast-Gods, leading to the eventual upheaval of their own creations against them. The Beast-Gods were struck down and those who vanquished them were known as the Ascended, the new gods of Daria.
This freedom was not without cost, however. The world became irrevocably tilted so that the southern pole is always aimed toward the sun and the northern pole toward the black of night. These places are called the Evernight and the Everday and have been cursed with the frigid cold of night and the deathly heat of day ever since.
The Ascended made peoples in their own likenesses, creating the species that populate Daria today. What followed is millennia of migration and convergence and magical discovery. Peoples, once spread far and wide, went to the safer places, where they mingled, giving rise to a melting pot of species. The world slowly healed, and the lands between the Everealms became a place for many peoples to thrive.
