## Magic
Magic in Daria comes from the deeper laws of nature. Physics, chemistry, biology, these are the shallow laws, magic is the deep laws. Sometimes a person might consciously understand some of these deep laws, that person might learn to wield the power. However, it is more common for a person to gain control over magic in other ways: they can be an instinctual understanding, a subconscious feeling, or simply a gift from one more powerful then themselves.
## The “Gods”
Long ago, there was a civilization now lost to history. People call them the Ascendants. They were the first to harness the deep laws of magic and learned to harness it with a skill unseen today. Their powers were unchecked, pushed beyond bound after bound until they nearly destroyed the world time and again, each time pulled back from the brink at the last second. This cycle ended when they finally made a pact and left the world to allow it to heal itself.
Those that left were unheard from again, departed to worlds of their own creations, but there were others who remained and stay to this day. Those who stayed became demigods, the first “gods” of Daria. At the current time, these demigods are worshipped by their followers and beseeched for the gift of powers. Below is a table of some of those that stayed.
