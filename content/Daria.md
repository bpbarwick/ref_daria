Daria is a world whose axial tilt is tidally locked to the sun. What this means is the northern pole is perpetually tilted away from the sun, causing a never ending night, and the southern pole is tilted toward the sun, causing a never ending day. These places are called the [[Evernight]] and the [[Everday]].
==When the gods ascended to godhood, Eitris, now the god of the sun, and Lutris, now god of the moon, tilted the world to gain more power. After the world suffered from the alterations of Eitris and Lutris, they saw how they had broken the world and departed for planes of existence of their own making to allow the world to heal. Many of the ascended gods followed.==
What followed is millennia of migration and convergence and magical discovery. Peoples, once spread far and wide, went to the safer places, where they mingled, giving rise to the many sentient species that inhabit Daria. As the departed gods hoped, the world has healed to a degree and the lands between the Everealms have become steadfast once more.
## The Sunfall Coast
A temperate region surrounding the Saltwash Sea, the Sunfall Coast was given its name due to the fact that the further north you travel along the coast, the faster the sun falls beyond the horizon. Itâ€™s pleasant climate along its southern shore and plentiful resources have given rise to trade centers and several nations.
