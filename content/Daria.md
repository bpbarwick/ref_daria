## The Sunfall Coast
A temperate region surrounding the Saltwash Sea, the Sunfall Coast was given its name due to the fact that the further north you travel along the coast, the faster the sun falls beyond the horizon. Until recently, much of the Sunfall Coast was dominated by the Emerald Empire, which brought stability and prosperity tot he realm. That began to end several decades ago as the empire’s authority began to crumble.
The receding Emerald Empire happened bit by bit, but now it’s borders only stretch as far east as the town of Trollbridge, leaving most of the Sunfall Coast unprotected and lawless. The power vacuum has been stoppered with local powers, warlords, raiders, and groups with their own interests at heart. 
And beyond the Sunfall Coast, the theocracy called Gatsya, has its own sights on the wealth of the coast, sending their agents and priests to sway the coastlanders to hand over their lands to the new Gatsyan god Long Dark.
The realm is a powder keg in every direction. There is no question that war will break out, the only question is where.
## The Disparate Peoples
### The Emerald Empire
*Yesteryear’s victors, tomorrow’s loser*
Dominant in all but the north of the Saltwash Sea for the last two hundred years, the Emerald Empire is now crumbling. Lands that were once within its borders are now without, leaving behind power vacuums and fearful locals.

### Free Peoples of the Lowlands<img src="media/places/Briarport.png" alt="Briarport" title="The City of Briarport" style="float:left;width:auto;height:300px;position:top;padding-right: 20px;">
*The many come together.*
A new entity in the region, The Free Peoples of the Lowlands were a unification of the peoples of the fertile lowlands south of the Kingdom of Skald. This region was the first area to be left behind by the Emerald Empire, forcing these peoples to unite to survive.
Perhaps most notable among these peoples are the nomadic centaurs found nowhere else in the Sunfall Coast. When a pact between empire citizens and the centaurs was signed agreeing to mutual benefit and protection, the Free Peoples were created.
The two most noteworthy settlements in this region include Briarport, a major trade port known for its cliffside views, and Cleft, a small city further inland that is built along a seam of wild magic that long ago split open into a deep crevasse.
Most eclectic of all the nations of the Sunfall Coast, the Free Peoples largely just want to keep their heads down and get the harvest in. 
### Gatsya
To the east of the mountains, lies a theocratic nation controlled by a priesthood to the new god Long Dark. Gatsya is growing in power and with it, its desire to expand. Gatsya is a nation that is centered around Lake Chevesk, which provides means for food and trade. 
Their Purifiers aim to purify the world through an inquisition targeting magic users who get their powers from unsanctioned gods. Rumors abound of Purifiers moving past the mountains, filling the void created by the Emerald Empire’s retreat.
### Guardian Mountain Clans

The raiders of the north, the Skalds are known for their ferocity in battle. Nowhere along the Sunfall Coast is safe from their plunder.
